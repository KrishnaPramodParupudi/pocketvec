PocketVec

PocketVec is a lightweight vector store designed for small to medium datasets. It allows you to efficiently create embeddings for a list of text chunks and retrieve the most similar chunks using either cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

PocketVec is ideal for users who want a fast and easy-to-use solution without needing heavy infrastructure or databases.

Quick Workflow Overview :
Texts → [Create embeddings] → [Retrieve similar chunks] → Results
         OR
Texts → [Create & Save embeddings] → [Load embeddings + Data] → [Retrieve similar chunks] → Results

Features : 

Lightweight & fast: Optimized for smaller datasets without external dependencies beyond sentence-transformers.

Flexible workflows:

Immediate use – create embeddings and retrieve related text chunks in one go, storing everything in memory.

Persistent embeddings – create embeddings, save them to a file, and reuse them later with the corresponding data chunks.

Similarity methods: Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

Easy integration: Works with any Python project with simple function calls.

How it works

Input: Provide your dataset as a list of text chunks.

Embedding: PocketVec generates embeddings for the texts using a HuggingFace sentence transformer.

Retrieve: Query the vector store to find the most similar chunks to your input query.

Optional persistence: Save embeddings for later use and reuse them with the original data chunks.

Recommended Usage

PocketVec supports two main workflows:

One-step embeddings and retrieval

Create embeddings for your data chunks.

Retrieve the top N most similar chunks to your query.

Separate creation and retrieval

Generate embeddings and save them to a file.

Later, load the embeddings and provide the original data chunks to perform retrieval.

Similarity Metrics

PocketVec supports the following similarity/distance metrics:

Cosine similarity – measures angular similarity between vectors.

Euclidean distance – measures straight-line distance between vectors in space.
